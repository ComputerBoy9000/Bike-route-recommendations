### Bicycle Route Recommender 

This project is the launching pad for a bicycle route recommendation system that accounts for multiple values relevant to a user's desires (length of the route, the grade of the streets along the route, the traffic conditions, etc.) It was built using Python 3, with the synthetic route data generated using custom functions built from NetworkX Directed Graph objects. NetworkX notably has functions and methods to convert multiple different graph files into NetworkX objects, so further iterations of the project could result in some implementations on real physical routes using urban network data extracted from software like ArcGIS. 

The prediction mechanism is a ****still not sure**** built using *****still not sure*****
